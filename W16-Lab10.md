# lab 10, Drew Taylor, David Wang

* Issue: The README.md needs updating in terms of screenshots and overall detailing of the menu. https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-simon-says/issues/29 (100 pts.)

* Issue: Clicking too fast or not constantly interacting with the JFrame can sometimes cause it to skip flashes. We believe this is an issue with the thread.sleep() function and the logic behind it used in the code. This issue is not always consistent. Sometimes the game works just fine so this could also just be an issue with JFrame and the application we are using to run the game. https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-simon-says/issues/30 (200 pts.)

* Issue: Using a textArea for the instructions allows the text to be editable. Making this text permanent would be a nice addition https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-simon-says/issues/31 (50 pts.)

* Issue: We think it would be cool to create customizable images for the buttons. Potentially ones the user could upload on their own through the game. Otherwise it would be cool to have images other than just the plain colors. https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-simon-says/issues/32 (150 pts.)

* Issue: Refactoring the code into an MVC design pattern is still a present issue https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-simon-says/issues/22 (300 pts.)
