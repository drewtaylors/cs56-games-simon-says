- The README is really well done. No real suggestions for improvement since he already lays
out images, titles, easy navigation, and project description.

- One of the bugs we noticed was that on a windows machine, the size of the screen is too small,
which makes the Simon blocks overlap with each other. We need to set a default minimum size to
fix this issue.

- There are JUnit tests that pass that check game logic and if constructors are generated properly.

- One feature that we think would really improve the game experience is adding a game over screen, 
since it is not very obvious to the user that the game ended unless the terminal is present.

- One thing we can do is merge the files, since most of the game logic and levels are written in separate files.

- Need to add javadoc comments. Most of the gui is commented, but it needs to be formatted better.
Need to comment the logic portion, so it is easier for people to understand what the code is doing.

- The build.xml file is to the point and covers the main operations that we care about: test, run, clean, javadoc.

- The package names correspond to the preferred naming convention for legacy code projects.

- The objects do not have too much functionality bundled into them. They are separated to perform the task they should
be doing without being unnecessarily long. Separating the objects further would overcomplicate the object relationships
without reason.
